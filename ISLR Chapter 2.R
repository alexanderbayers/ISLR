#Problem 2.1
#a. Flexible model - there is minimal variance because on average because there are so many samples
#b. Less flexible model - Variance is extremely high so it's more likely to have spurious errors
#c. Flexible model - we don't want to add too much bias that will prevent us from capturing this nonlinearity.
#d. Lesss flexible model - high variance of error terms makes it more prone to overfitting.

#Problem 2.2
#a.
